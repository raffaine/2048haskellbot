2048haskellbot
==============

A Haskell bot to play 2048, using "2048 as a service" as my motor and doing REST calls with the moves.

https://github.com/Semantics3/2048-as-a-service

The main purpose is to create a bot following the minimax tree strategy, but using expect branches as the min levels, because there is no adversary, only random piece placement.
